            <ul class="ingredients-list">
               <li class="ingredient">3 to 3 1/2 pounds(1.3 to 1.6 kg) boneless rump roast.</li>
               <li class="ingredient">1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil.</li>
               <li class="ingredient">8-10 slivers garlic (3 to 4 cloves, sliced in half or into thirds).</li>
               <li class="ingredient">Salt and pepper.</li>
               <li class="ingredient">Red wine, water, and/or beef stock.</li>
               <li class="ingredient">1 tablespoon cornstarch.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="recipe-preparation-title">Preparation</h2>
            <ul class="preparation-list">
               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Salt the roast and let it come to room temp:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">The beef should be brought as close to room temperature as possible before you start
                     to roast it, so that it cooks more
                     evenly. Remove it from the refrigerator at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours, before cooking. Open
                     the wrapping, sprinkle
                     all sides with salt, and wrap it up again.</p>
               </li>

               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Preheat the oven to 375°F:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">(190°C). Move a rack to the center of the oven, and place the other one underneath.
                  </p>
               </li>

               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Insert slivers of garlic into the roast:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">Pat the roast dry with paper towels. Use the tip of a sharp knife to make 8 to 10
                     small incisions around the roast. Put
                     a sliver of garlic into each cut.</p>
               </li>

               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Rub the roast with olive oil, then season:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">Rub olive oil all over the roast. Sprinkle it all around with salt and pepper.</p>
               </li>

               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Put the roast on the rack with a pan below:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">Place the roast directly on the middle oven rack, fatty side up, with a roasting pan
                     to catch the drippings on the rack
                     beneath it.</p>
                  <p class="step-p">Placing the roast directly on the rack like this with a pan on the rack below
                     creates a convection type environment in
                     the oven, allowing the hot air to more easily circulate around the roast, so you don't have to turn
                     the roast as it
                     cooks.</p>
                  <p class="step-p">Place the roast, fat-side up so that as the fat bathes the entire roast in flavor as
                     it melts.</p>
               </li>

               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Brown at 375°F, then lower the heat to 225°F:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">Cook the roast initially at 375°F (190°C) for half an hour, to brown it. Then lower
                     the heat to 225°F (107°C). The roast
                     should take somewhere from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours more to cook.</p>
                  <p class="step-p">The shape of the roast will affect the cooking time. If your roast is long and
                     narrow, rather than a more round shape,
                     it may take less time to cook, so keep an eye on it.</p>
               </li>

               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Roast to an internal temp of 135°F to 140°F:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">When juices start to drip from the roast, and it is browned on the outside, check
                     the roast's internal temperature with
                     a meat thermometer. Remove the roast from the oven when the internal temperature of the roast is
                     135°F to 140°F (for
                     medium rare meat).</p>
               </li>

               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Make the gravy as the roast rests:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">Place the roast on a cutting board and tent it with aluminum foil to keep it warm.
                     Let it rest for 20 to 30 minutes
                     before cutting. (Resting the cooked roast is important. If you cut into it too soon, the roast will
                     lose more of its
                     juices.)</p>
                  <p class="step-p">To make the gravy: Remove the dripping pan from the oven and place on the stove top
                     at medium heat. Note that if you are
                     pulling the roast out early, for rare or a medium rare level of doneness, you may not have a lot of
                     drippings. Hopefully
                     you will have some. If not, you may want to leave the roast in a little longer at even lower heat,
                     175°F, to ease some
                     more drippings out of it.</p>
                  <p class="step-p">Add some water, red wine, or beef stock to the drippings to deglaze (loosen the
                     drippings from the pan). Dissolve a
                     tablespoon of cornstarch in a little water and add to the drip pan. Stir quickly while the gravy
                     thickens to avoid
                     lumping.</p>
                  <p class="step-p">You can add a little butter if there is not a lot of fat in the drippings. Add salt
                     and pepper to taste. Mom adds some
                     fresh thyme too if she has some.</p>
               </li>

               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Slice and serve:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">After the roast has had a chance to rest a bit (and reabsorb its juices), thinly
                     slice the roast to serve. (A sturdy
                     long bread knife works well for slicing roasts.)</p>
                  <p class="step-p">Pour the gravy over the slices or serve on the side.</p>

                  <h3 class="step-title">Arrange rack, preheat the oven, and prepare the baking sheet:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">Place the rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a
                     large-rimmed baking sheet with foil, being
                     sure to leave several inches of overhang on both long ends to make your foil packet.</p>
               </li>

               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Prepare the salmon:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">While the oven preheats, remove the salmon from the fridge to come to temperature,
                     15-20 minutes. Place the salmon on
                     the prepared pan and pat both sides dry with a paper towel. Feel the flesh for any bones and remove
                     them with fish
                     tweezers or your fingers.</p>
               </li>

               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Season the salmon:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">Season both sides of the salmon with salt and pepper.</p>
               </li>

               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Make the butter sauce and pour over salmon:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">In a small bowl, combine the melted butter, garlic, honey, and lemon juice. Fold up
                     the edges of the foil to contain the
                     liquid and pour the butter mixture evenly over the top of the salmon.</p>
               </li>

               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Seal the salmon with foil:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">Bring the two long sides of the foil together and then fold them down a few times to
                     close the top of your packet. Then,
                     tuck each end under to close the sides. If your piece of foil is not large enough, take a second
                     sheet of foil and cover
                     the salmon, pinching the foil to seal the edges.</p>
               </li>

               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Bake the salmon:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">If you're cooking farm-raised salmon, it should be done in 18-20 minutes, depending
                     on the thickness. If you're using
                     wild-caught salmon, check for doneness beginning at 10 minutes. If you open the packet and see the
                     fish isn't finished
                     cooking, it should be opaque on top and flake easily with a fork, close the foil packet back up,
                     return it to the oven,
                     and check again in another 2-3 minutes.</p>
               </li>

               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Broil the salmon:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">Carefully open the foil package to uncover the salmon completely, pushing the foil
                     down and out of the way.</p>
                  <p class="step-p">Set the oven to broil on high. If you have an electric stove, return the salmon to
                     the oven, still on the middle rack.
                     Broil the salmon for 2-3 minutes. You'll see it turn just slightly golden with some charred spots
                     but be sure not to
                     burn the garlic.</p>
                  <p class="step-p">If you have a gas stove, you may want to reduce your broiling time to 1 minute or
                     skip it all together.</p>
               </li>

               <li class="preparation-step">
                  <h3 class="step-title">Serve:</h3>
                  <p class="step-p">Let the salmon rest for about 5 minutes. Garnish with chopped herbs. Transfer to a
                     serving platter or serve directly
                     from the pan!</p>
